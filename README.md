# Introduction
WPF UI is a library designed for building modern user interfaces in a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) environment.  
By default, the library is created for `.NET 6`. If you want to know more about .NET 6, [have a look here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-6).

### Windows Presentation Foundation
Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) is a free and open-source graphical subsystem (similar to WinForms) originally developed by Microsoft for rendering user interfaces in Windows-based applications.  
WPF has been open-source for a while, so you can see [how the library is built here](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf).

### Fluent
The philosophy behind the WPF UI look is Fluent by Microsoft. Keep in mind, however, that as creators, we leave ourselves some artistic freedom to style the library controls, e.g. similar to Windows 11 system programs.
